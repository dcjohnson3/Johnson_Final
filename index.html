			<h3>Summary of the dataset</h3>
			<p>Mass shootings are a complex, tragic, and unfortunately common occurrence in America. Many people throughout the country study the gun violence commonly occurring in the United States. </p>
			<p>One of the organizations that does this is <a href="https://www.theviolenceproject.org"> the Violence Project.</a> They have compiled a database of all mass public shootings that have occurred since 1966 and their perpetrator profiles. The Violence Project is a non-profit, government-affiliated organization with the goal of decreasing gun violence of all types across the country. This in-depth public mass shooting dataset has a lot of information that is newsworthy and important for people to know today. With the constant increase in mass shootings each year, it is important to study these trends to see what can be done to combat this all too common violence.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Definitions and limitations</h3>
			<p>When looking at this dataset, it is vital to understand what is defined as a mass shooting. The Violence Project uses the Congressional Research Service definition of a mass public shooting which is as follows: <i> “…a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms—not including the offender(s)—within one event, and at least some of the murders occurred in a public location or locations in close geographical proximity (e.g., a workplace, school, restaurant, or other public settings), and the murders are not attributable to any other underlying criminal activity or commonplace circumstance (armed robbery, criminal competition, insurance fraud, argument, or romantic triangle).” </i> </p>

			<p>This data uses the 1966 University of Texas shooting as its first data point because it is considered to be the first modern mass shooting. This means it unfolded live on TV and radio. These limitations are important to keep in mind as this data is analyzed. </p>

			<h3>Mass shootings are becoming more common</h3>
			<p>By breaking down the dataset I was able to find that there was a 45% increase in mass shootings from before 1999 compared to after 2000. Between 1966-2000, 77 mass shootings were recorded. From 2000-2022, 112 mass shootings were recorded. This shows a 45% increase in shootings even though there are 12 fewer years included after 2000.</p>

			<p> <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/research-and-practice/center-for-gun-violence-solutions/team"> Lisa Geller,</a> a Staff Affairs Advisor at the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/research-and-practice/center-for-gun-violence-solutions">Center for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins University,</a> provides some context as to why we are seeing this rise in mass shootings. “You can point to a lot of different reasons for why mass shootings are happening more often, but the main reason is simply that there are more guns now than there have been before,” she says. </p>

			<p>She explains that the United States continues to produce more guns at a rapid rate while the already large amount stays in circulation. With this increasingly large amount of guns, it makes it easier for them to get into the hands of more vulnerable and younger individuals - both legally and illegally. </p>

			<h3>State population, strong laws, and amount of shootings are all connected</h3>
			<p>Throughout my findings, I was able to see that California has had the most modern mass shootings out of all states. California has had 28 mass shootings recorded since 1966. This comes out to be .0712 mass shootings per 100,000 people. This may make it seem as though California doesn't have strict gun laws, but it is quite the opposite. California’s seemingly large amount of mass shootings can be mostly attributed to its large population.</p>

			<iframe title="California, Texas, and Florida among states with the highest amount of mass shootings" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-t1smT" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t1smT/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="555" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

			<p>California is known for having some of the most strict gun laws in the country, so it may come as a surprise to see that their mass shooting rate is so high. According to <a href="https://giffords.org/"> Giffords Law Center,</a> an organization ran by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords that is fighting for gun safety, <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/states/california/"> California gets a grade “A” on its gun law scorecard.</a> Giffords Center says, “California has the strongest gun safety laws in the nation and has been a trailblazer for gun safety reform for the past 30 years.” Some of these laws include universal background checks, safe storage laws, and ammunition regulation.</p>

			<p>North Carolina has the same rate of mass shootings, .07 per 100,000 people, despite their population being almost 29 million fewer people than California. Giffords gives <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/states/north-carolina/"> North Carolina a “C-” grade</a> for their gun safety. North Carolina is missing many laws that California has including universal background checks, minimum age restrictions, and assault weapon restrictions.</p>

			<p>When comparing rates between states, it is evident that strong laws help combat higher levels of gun violence.</p>

			<h3>Who are the perpetrators?</h3>
			<p>This dataset also goes into detail about each perpetrator of these shootings. Within this data, there is a common theme between the people that commit these crimes. Most of the shooters are young to middle-aged white men. The average age of a shooter is 34 while the most common, or mode, age is 21 and 28. 55% of the shooters are white and 97% are men.</p>

			<iframe title="100 out of 180 mass shooters are white" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-9D3Vf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9D3Vf/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

			<p>This demographic is the one that is targeted by gun advertising the most. Geller explains that young men tend to feel more disconnected from society and this, combined with targeted advertising, drives this demographic to be purchasing guns more often. “Young men are the target for almost all gun advertising. These ads play into the idea that buying a gun will give them a sense of purpose or belonging,” she says.</p>

			<h3>Gun legislation moving forward</h3>
			<p> Gun violence is not new to America, so it can be hard to understand why these tragedies continue to happen so often. One main issue is the legislature difference in each state. Getting gun control laws passed at the federal level seems to be almost impossible with Congress getting gun control bills stuck in the Senate. “We are kind of seeing this trend where there's becoming ‘two Americas’, ” says Geller.</p>

			<p>There are the democratic controlled states that are passing new gun control laws more and more often. Washington, for example, just passed a ban on AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles. These states are adding more background checks and bans on certain types of weapons. Geller cites Michigan as a state that her office is working with a lot recently as their entire Congress consists of a Democratic majority currently.</p>

			<p>Republican controlled states, such as Alabama or Missouri, don’t have much movement in their gun control laws. Many Republican lawmakers are introducing laws to make getting a gun easier for anyone. With these two parties having different views on how gun violence should be handled, the states are seemingly divided.</p>

			<p>Organizations like The Violence Project are going to continue compiling data on mass shootings and keep helping to introduce laws at both the state and federal levels to combat gun violence. They want to achieve their, and the majority of America's ultimate goal; a society where mass shootings of any kind are non-existent.</p>
